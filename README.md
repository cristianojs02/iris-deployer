## Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` defines the Docker container environment that will execute the GitHub Action. It is built in two stages to optimize the final image size.

**Stage 1: `builder`**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12.3-slim-bookworm AS builder
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Installs the 'requests' library directly into the application directory
RUN pip install --target=/app requests
```

* `FROM python:3.12.3-slim-bookworm AS builder`: Defines the base image for building as a slim version of Python 3.12 based on Debian Bookworm. This stage is named `builder`.
* `ADD . /app`: Copies the entire contents of the project directory to the `/app` directory inside the container.
* `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory for subsequent commands to `/app`.
* `RUN pip install --target=/app requests`: Installs the `requests` library, which is used by the Python class to make HTTP calls to the IRIS API. The `--target=/app` parameter ensures that the library is installed within the `/app` directory.

**Stage 2: Final Image**

```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
COPY --from=builder /app /app
WORKDIR /app
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
CMD ["/app/iris_deployer.py"]
```

* `FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12`: Uses a "distroless" image from Google Container Tools with Python 3. This image is minimal, containing only the necessary dependencies to run Python applications, including SSL certificates. This results in a smaller and more secure final image.
* `COPY --from=builder /app /app`: Copies the contents of the `/app` directory from the build stage (`builder`) to the `/app` directory of the final image. This includes your application code and the installed `requests` library.
* `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory for subsequent commands to `/app`.
* `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app`: Sets the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable so that Python can find the modules within the `/app` directory.
* `CMD ["/app/iris_deployer.py"]`: Defines the main command to be executed when the container starts. In this case, it runs the Python script `iris_deployer.py`.

## Python Class `IrisDeployer`

The `IrisDeployer` class (`iris_deployer.py`) is responsible for interacting with the InterSystems IRIS REST API to perform deployment operations.

**Features:**

* **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    * Configures basic logging.
    * Stores connection information to the IRIS server (host, port, namespace), protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), API base URL, API version, IRIS user credentials, default compilation flags, and the source file path.
    * Constructs the URLs for different REST API operations (put document, delete documents, get document, and compile documents).
    * Creates a `requests` session with the headers `Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: */*`, and HTTP basic authentication.

* **`compile_docs(self, doc_list: str)`**:
    * Receives a JSON string containing a list of files to compile.
    * Makes a `POST` request to the IRIS compilation URL, passing the list of files and compilation flags.
    * Processes the API response, displaying log messages for success, warning, or error based on the HTTP status code and the response content (IRIS compiler console output).
    * Sets the internal flag `__has_error` to `True` in case of compilation or request errors.

* **`delete_docs(self, doc_list: str)`**:
    * Receives a JSON string containing a list of files to delete.
    * Makes a `DELETE` request to the IRIS delete documents URL, sending the list of files in the request body.
    * Processes the API response, displaying log messages for success or error based on the HTTP status code and the response content.

* **`deploy_docs(self, changed_files: list)`**:
    * Receives a list of files that have been modified or created.
    * Iterates over each file in the list:
        * Constructs the document name for IRIS by removing the `source_path` and replacing slashes (`/`) with periods (`.`).
        * Checks if the document already exists in IRIS using the `get_doc()` method.
        * If the document exists, it retrieves the last modification timestamp (`ts`) and sets the `If-None-Match` header in the `requests` session to avoid conflict errors during updates if the document hasn't changed on the server.
        * Reads the content of the local file.
        * Formats the content into a JSON dictionary (`{'enc': False, 'content': [...]}`).
        * Sends the document to IRIS using the `put_doc()` method.
    * After sending all individual documents, it constructs a JSON list of all changed files (with the IRIS document name format) and calls the `compile_docs()` method to compile all files at once.

* **`get_doc(self, file_name: str)`**:
    * Receives the file name (IRIS document format).
    * Makes a `GET` request to the URL for retrieving a specific document.
    * Processes the API response. It's noted that the API might return a 409 (Conflict) status even for existing documents, which is handled to avoid false errors.
    * Returns the content of the JSON response on success (status 200) or `None` if the document is not found (status 404). In case of other errors, it sets the `__has_error` flag.

* **`put_doc(self, source_document: str, file_name: str)`**:
    * Receives the document content and the file name (IRIS document format).
    * Makes a `PUT` request to the URL for sending a specific document, sending the JSON content in the request body.
    * Processes the API response, displaying log messages for different status codes (success, warning for conflict/locking, error).
    * Sets the `__has_error` flag in case of request errors.

* **`exit(self)`**:
    * Checks the value of the `__has_error` flag. If `True`, it exits the script with an exit code of 1 (indicating an error). Otherwise, it exits with an exit code of 0 (success).

* **`in_debug_mode()`**:
    * Utility function to check if the Python script is being run in debug mode.

* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`**:
    * Main execution block of the script.
    * If not in debug mode (running as a GitHub Action):
        * Creates an instance of the `IrisDeployer` class by reading the IRIS server configurations and changed/deleted file information from environment variables (`INPUT_*`).
        * Calls the `deploy_docs()` method to send the changed files.
        * Calls the `delete_docs()` method to remove the deleted files.
        * Calls the `exit()` method to finalize execution with the appropriate exit code.
    * If in debug mode (running locally):
        * Defines example values for configurations and the file list for local testing.
        * Creates an instance of `IrisDeployer` and calls the `deploy_docs()` and `delete_docs()` methods with the test data.

## How to Configure and Use

To use this GitHub Action in your project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

* An InterSystems IRIS server with the source code management REST API configured and accessible through a WebServer.
* Credentials for an IRIS user with permissions to interact with the REST API (create, update, compile, and delete documents).
* Your source code organized in a GitHub repository.

### GitHub Action Configuration

1.  Create a YAML file within the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository (for example, `.github/workflows/deploy_iris.yml`).

2.  Paste the following content into the file, adapting it to your needs:

```yaml
# Template of a workflow to create, upate, delete and compile source documents on IRIS
name: Deploy to IRIS
# Trigger execute action
on:
  push:
    # All push to these branchs trigger the action Deploy to IRIS 
    branches:
      - <main>
  # All puspull_requesth to these branchs trigger the action Deploy to IRIS
  #pull_request:
  #  branches:
  #    - <put you branch>
#  Allow manually worflow execution
#  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy-to-iris:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # The 2 steps bellow checkout the changed files to deploy to IRIS, don't change.
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Get changed files and write the outputs to a JSON file
        id: modified-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v44
        with:
          separator: ","
          files: |
              **/*.{cls,mac,int,inc}
      # Final checkout files
      - name: Depoly to IRIS
        uses: cristianojs02/iris-deployer@main
        with:
          host: '<IP or Host Name>'
          port: '<Port Number>'
          namespace_iris: '<CODENAMESPACE>'
          # 0 - HTTP, 1 - HTTPS 
          https: '0'
          base_api_url: '/api/atelier'
          version_api: 'v2'
          # Change if you don't want default flags compilation
          compilation_flags: 'cukb'
          # Used to extract from document name before sen to IRIS, avoiding Document Not found error.
          source_path: 'src/'
          # Use github secrets
          iris_usr: '${{ secrets.IRIS_USER }}'
          iris_pwd: '${{ secrets.IRIS_PWD }}'
          # don't change bellow lines
          changed_files: '${{ steps.modified-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}'
          deleted_files: '${{ steps.modified-files.outputs.deleted_files }}'
```

3.  **Important:** Store sensitive information (host, port, namespace, user, password, etc.) as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-secrets#creating-and-managing-encrypted-secrets). Replace the direct values in the YAML file with references to your secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.IRIS_USER }}`).

4.  Adapt the `source_path` in the `Deploy to IRIS` step to match your project structure.

### Workflow Example

The example workflow above will run whenever there is a `push` to the `main` branch. It performs the following steps:

1.  **Checkout code:** Downloads your repository code to the GitHub Actions runner.
2.  **Identify changed and deleted files:** identify files that have been modified or added `${{ steps.modified-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}` and files that have been deleted `${{ steps.modified-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}`.
3.  **Deploy to IRIS:** Uses your custom "Deploy To IRIS" action, passing the necessary inputs using the GitHub Secrets and the output from the previous step.
